# Acceptance Criteria 
The project is done when it meets all the rules listed below.
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

# Refactors I made
Changed most of the divs so they go in HTML semantic order, such as header, nav, article, etc.

Organzied the format of CSS so that it goes along with the structure of HTML.
